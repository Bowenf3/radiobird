# What is RadioBird?
RadioBird is a simple Radio App which provides users with more than 20,000 radio stations from across the globe! I personally love music, foreign languages and learning about foreign cultures - giving birth to RadioBird. 

In addition to giving you access to the world's radio, RadioBird also includes the following features:

 - Sleep Timer
 - Radio Alarm
 - Saving your Recent Listens & Favourties
 - Browse By Genre or Country

# Tech Stack
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Context API
- NodeJS
- Expo Client

# Next Steps

My love for the Radio and RadioBird doesn't stop here -

Adding Podcasts
Linking a song recognizer API so the user can find out the name of the song they're listening to!
